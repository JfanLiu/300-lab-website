Officially, today I start as an Assistant Professor and PI of [Pividori Lab](https://pivlab.org/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi), [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).
I won't write a long post about my feelings, but I'm very excited about this new stage in my career.
I invite you to keep an eye on this blog, [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/miltondp) and our [GitHub repos](https://github.com/pivlab) for updates about our research and other activities.
We are recruiting, so if your interests overlap with [our labs'](https://pivlab.org/preview/pr-7/research/), please reach out!
