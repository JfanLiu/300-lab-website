* 12/01/2023: [*Decomposed Linear Dynamical Systems (dLDS) for learning the latent components of neural dynamics*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06402)

* 11/03/2023: [*Expressive dynamics models with nonlinear injective readouts enable reliable recovery of latent features from neural activity*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06402)

* 10/27/2023: Grant presented his work on Graph Neural Networks to predict olfactory receptor ligands. Great work Grant!

* 10/13/2023: The lab worked on their NSF's together. Good luck everyone!

* 10/06/2023: Ryan finished presentation on the role of astrocytes in fear learning.

* 09/29/2023: The first official DePasquale lab meeting! Ryan discussed his prior work in Dr. Steve Ramirez's lab looking at the role of astrocytes in fear learning. Great job Ryan!

Lab Fun
======

* 11/09/2023: The lab had a special lab meeting at Eastern Standard where we discussed which cocktails tasted the best and how we can use LLM's in our research!
