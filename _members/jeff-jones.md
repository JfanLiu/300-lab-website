Jeff obtained his Ph.D. in 2015 in the lab of Dr. Douglas McMahon at Vanderbilt University where his research focused on the bidirectional relationship between the molecular and electrical rhythms in the brain's biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). After a brief postdoc with Dr. Luis de Lecea at Stanford University to learn in vivo imaging, Jeff joined the lab of Dr. Erik Herzog at Washington University in St. Louis in 2016, where he studied the inputs to and outputs from the SCN that together generate circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology. In 2021, Jeff started his lab in the Department of Biology at Texas A&M.
