Liyun Zhu is a second year master’s student in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the Australian National University (ANU). He is currently conducting research under the joint supervision of Dr. Lei Wang (ANU & Data61/CSIRO) and Prof. Chen Chen (University of Central Florida). Liyun’s research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with a particular focus on video anomaly detection, video understanding, large language models, and face forgery detection.

Prior to his master’s studies, Liyun earned his Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai University in 2023, where he was mentored by Prof. Yongfang Wang. During his undergraduate studies, Liyun participated in Shanghai University’s Outstanding Undergraduate Program, initiating his research in this specialized field.

His academic journey is complemented by extensive industry experience. As a Model Optimization Intern at Biren Tech, a leading Chinese semiconductor company, Liyun contributed to research on advanced large language models and optimized LLM performance in distributed systems across 16 nodes and 128 GPUs. In 2023, he served as a Research Intern at Active Intelligence (Australia), where he developed advanced anomaly detection algorithms and contributed to a novel dataset. Earlier, as an Algorithm Intern at Anji Tech, he focused on the industrial implementation of anomaly detection systems.

Liyun’s academic achievements have garnered recognition. He was awarded the Active Intelligence Research Challenge Award in 2023 and received the Self-improvement Scholarship during his undergraduate studies for outstanding academic performance.
