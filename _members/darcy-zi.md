Darcy joined the DePasquale Lab in 2023 as a neuroscience PhD student, co-mentored by [Mark Howe](https://www.bu.edu/kilachandcenter/the-team/mark-howe/). She received a B.E. in Electronic & Information Engineering from Zhejiang University of Technology, China, and an M.S. in Bioengineering from UC San Diego. Her previous research experience includes using scalp EEG (electroencephalography) to capture human brain state transitions under hypnotherapy, and using stereo-EEG to explore cortical and subcortical responses to vagus nerve stimulation. Currently, she is interested in using fiber photometry to study neuromodulators' role in adaptive learning in the striatum in mouse models. Beyond research, Darcy enjoys chilling with her dog Puffle in a park, being active outdoors, and exploring restaurants in the city.
