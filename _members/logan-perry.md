Logan is a rising senior at Texas A&M University currently studying computer science and completing his medical school prerequisites. Logan joined the Jones Lab during Fall 2021, and is hoping to pursue an MD/PhD program in neuroscience because of his experiences in the lab. Away from research, Logan loves experimenting with all sorts of baking and cooking.
