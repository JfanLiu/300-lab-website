# MMB-BioIT

Population genetics:
The worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria causing difficult to treat infections highlights the importance to track their local and global transmission. Using WGS or metagenomic sequences, different bioinformatic tools are used to group these bacteria based on the core and/or accessory genome, including mobile genetic elements encoding e.g. antibiotic resistance genes. In addition, we developed tools to reconstruct plasmids based on short read sequences in order to determine transmission patterns of mobile genetic elements.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections worldwide highlights the importance of monitoring these outbreaks. We analyse and provide tools to characterize these bacteria, their mobile genetic elements and their transmission patterns.
