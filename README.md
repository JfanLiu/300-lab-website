## For new lab members

- To create a member profile, clone this repository locally, and then duplicate any existing profile located in [`/_members`](https://github.com/depasquale-lab/depasquale-lab.github.io/tree/main/_members). Rename the file, update the file with your information, upload a photo to the `/images` directory, then add, committ and push!
- To update your member profile, find your .md file in [`/_members`](https://github.com/depasquale-lab/depasquale-lab.github.io/tree/main/_members), make the necessary changes, and then push!

## Previewing the website before pushing to main

- Make a new branch from `main`, then switch to this branch.
- Make edits to the website on this branch, and then push those changes to that branch on github.
- Open a pull request to merge your branch with `main`.
- When you open or update a pull request on GitHub, the template will build a live preview of the changes you are making to your site. A public link to the preview will be in a comment on the pull request. This way, reviewers and editors can see the tangible result of the changes conveniently.
