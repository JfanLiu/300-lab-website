Biological neural networks compute differently than most artificial neural networks used in machine learning. For example, although real neurons communicate with spikes, reproducing this feature in artificial models has been a challenge. We develop methods for training biophysically detailed neural networks and use thse models to understand how real biologial circuits compute. Through mathematical modeling, we focus on building tighter links between biologial neural networks and more abstract artifical neural network models used in machine learning.

Neural recordings from behaving animals are often much too complex to link directly to an animal's ongoing behavior. We develop machine learning models to analyze complex neural datasets to understand the algorithms that underlie different behaviors. We principally focus on the neural underpinnings of movement and decision making.

The olfactory system poses interesting challenges from a machine learning perspective. We are developing graph neural networks to model odorous chemicals, aiming to understand how odors are translated into neural activity at the periphery of the system. Additionally, we are developing connectome contrained models of higher processing areas in the olfactory system to glean insights into how these chemicals are processed and lead to behavior.

[Keep an eye out for upcoming papers!]
