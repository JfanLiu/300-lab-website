### Monarch Initiative: Disease diagnosis and discovery

%}

Over the last 20 years, the genomic revolution has provided tremendous amounts of knowledge in nearly all scientific fields, especially genomic medicine.
But that data is complex, exists in different forms, and is distributed across different locations.
It can also be incomplete or conflicting, or downright overwhelming to identify what parts of available knowledge are relevant to any given question.

The challenges right now are not due to lack of data--there is a huge and growing amount of data.
What we lack are tools to make effective use of that data for everyone.
The Monarch Initiative was recently expanded through a $10M award to establish a Center of Excellence in Genomic Sciences (CEGS) and develop tools to address exactly this data problem.
Through the CEGS project, scientists and physicians at four institutions in the U.S. and U.K are collaborating to develop those tools.

Monarch is a collaboration among members TISLab, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, The Jackson Laboratory For Genomic Medicine, RTI International, Genomics England/Queen Mary, Ada Health, and EMBL-EBI

### Phenomics-First Resource

  height="100px"

The human genome has been sequenced, and yet so much is unknown about what it does; what we do know is scattered across multiple, heterogeneous data sources that are difficult to integrate.
The Phenomics-First Resource (PFR) coordinates the efforts of a large community of researchers and clinicians to help interpret the relationship between the differences (called variants) in a patient’s genome and their physical characteristics (phenotypes).
We are using the emerging field of phenomics to improve precision medicine and innovate in evolutionary biology.
Patients with rare diseases will particularly benefit from this research; it takes an average of seven years to get a diagnosis for a rare disease, and even then the initial diagnosis is often wrong.
Phenomics can be applied in a range of fields, but in this case the researchers are primarily focused on human disease and drawing insights from laboratory organisms.

The PFR will gather and unify the data from numerous sources to advance genomic interpretation in clinical settings, and will empower both researchers and clinicians to overcome long-standing barriers to discovery and patient care.
This project forms the basis of a Center of Excellence in Genomic Science, a program of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

### Converging Genomics, Phenomics, and Environments Using Interpretable Machine Learning Models

{%
  include figure.html
  image="images/translational-science.png"
  height="100px"
%}

TISLab is revolutionizing our understanding of how genes are transformed into organism traits in a changing environment.
One of the central dogmas of biology is that genes and environments work together to determine the characteristics of an organism, or its phenotype.
Yet, being able to predict with precision what an organism will look like or do based on its genes and environment has, for the most part, remained out of reach.
Turns out, there’s a lot going on in a cell and in an organism that we just don’t understand which has a huge impact on how that organism looks and behaves.
In addition to revolutionizing the way we think about how genes are expressed, we have to develop brand new ways of transforming and analyzing data so we can make best use of innovations in artificial intelligence and deep learning.
TISLab is leading this effort to innovate in computer science and biology to combat the negative effects of climate change on public health, conservation, and agriculture.

### Forums for Integrative Phenomics

TISLab is bursting through communication barriers to advance science.
One of the biggest barriers to scientific advancement is lack of communication across different kinds of expertise, especially between researchers who study genetics, environmental science, and phenomics.
This results in data that are totally incompatible with each other and blocks scientific progress.
The goal of this project is to bring together a diverse range of research scientists and clinicians from these three areas to find ways to communicate and share data.
Unified data enables new insights in relationships between diseases, genes, and environments in a wide range of species.
TISLab is creating new discoveries by planning and hosting workshops for creating new data standards that act as a “rosetta stone” between disciplines.

### Center for Cancer Data Harmonization

{%

%}

TISLab is leading development of a data-powered support infrastructure to cure and treat cancer.
The data that researchers need to develop new life saving therapies spans disciplines and biological scales, especially where personalized approaches are needed.
Currently, integrating data ranging from genomes and cellular components to patients and symptoms is a significant barrier to research.

To address these issues TISLab is taking a leading role in the Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH) whose mission is to bring data together across the various nodes of NCI’s Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) and make them accessible to researchers of any discipline in the fight against cancer.

### Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Data Resource Center

{%

%}

TISLab is fighting pediatric cancer by supporting The Kids First Data Resource Portal, one of the largest collections of integrated genomic and clinical data for some childhood diseases, which previously were studied largely in isolation.
Kids First brings together heterogeneous data from childhood cancers and structural birth defects to support research, study, and collaboration built on top of an unprecedented collection of genetic and phenotypic data from pediatric patients.
The data in the Data Resource Portal is curated and structured using biomedical ontologies, including the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Mondo Disease Ontology to allow for query and retrieval of symptoms, findings and disease features across the cohorts.
Additional work is being done in collaboration with the INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) project to augment the Kids First Data Resource Center’s ability to integrate survey data for assessment of Down Syndrome-related clinical data and neurobehavior.

%}

TISLab is leading the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) using team science and translational research to improve patient care.
CD2H accelerates advancements in informatics by using findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles to promote collaboration across the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program community.
CD2H tools and resources make it simple and valuable for CTSA Program members to get engaged, connect with peers, and contribute.
By promoting collaboration, CD2H fosters a robust translational science informatics ecosystem that collectively develops solutions to solve clinical problems faster, more efficiently, and more effectively.
CTSA Program members are poised to lead this charge by harnessing collective expertise and strengths to solve key informatics challenges.

The [National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)](https://ncats.nih.gov/) and the [National Center for Data to Health (CD2H)](https://cd2h.org/) have created the [National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)](https://covid.cd2h.org/) Data Enclave.
The N3C aims to aggregate, harmonize, and make accessible vast amounts of data from healthcare providers nationwide to accelerate advances in COVID-19 research and clinical care.
With the uncertainty of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the scientific community and Clinical and [Translational Science Awards (CTSA)](https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa) Program created the N3C partnership to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to harmonizing and sharing individual-level clinical data.

N3C welcomes researchers and citizen scientists to sign up and register for access to this nationwide, comprehensive health records dataset.
