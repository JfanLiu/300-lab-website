I am an [assistant professor](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/brian-depasquale-ph-d/) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University where I run the Artificial and Biological Intelligence Laboratory. I did my postdoctoral research with [Carlos Brody](http://brodylab.org/) and [Jonathan Pillow](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/jpillow/) on latent variable models of evidence accumulation. During my Ph.D., I worked with [Larry Abbott](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/neurotheory/Larry/) developing methods for training recurrent neural networks, and with [Mark Churchland](https://churchland.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/mark-m-churchland) connecting these models conceptually to statistical models of low-dimensional dynamics applied to data. Before that I studied the basal ganglia in the laboratory of Ann Graybiel at MIT and completed by BS in physics at Fordham University.

## Interested in joining?
### Prospective PhDs
If you are interested in conducting research within the group as a PhD student, please apply to the BU BME [PhD program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-biomedical-engineering/) or the BU graduate program in [neuroscience](  https://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/). Unfortunately, I cannot respond to individual email inquiries about joining my group as a PhD student. If you are interested, apply to one of the programs above. 

### Admitted PhD students
My rotation project policy is to encourage you to bring your **own ideas** to the table. I try not to 'assign' projects (although I will if needed)!

### Postdocs
If you are interested in a postdoc, please [email Brian](mailto:bddepasq@bu.edu).
