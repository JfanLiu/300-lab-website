  description: Here we introduce the PhenoPLIER framework, an omnigenic approach that integrates genetic studies (GWAS/TWAS) with gene modules learned from expression data. PhenoPLIER provides 1) a regression framework that computes an association between gene modules and diseases, 2) a clustering approach that finds groups of diseases with shared transcriptomic properties, and 3) a gene module-based drug-repurposing method.
