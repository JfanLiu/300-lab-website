  description: "plasmidEC identifies plasmid-derived contigs in E. coli. This tool combines the output of three binary classification tools and implements a majority vote system. Currently, the user can choose any combination of the following four softwares: PlaScope, Platon, RFPlasmid and mlplasmids. More softwares could be added in the future."
