  description: "To perform the identification of focused regions, image segmentation refers to a process of dividing an image into multiple regions. We will analyze and point out the most fundamental differences in the gradient strength of the same image pixel or image region in near and far focus image. And then, we combine the defined areas to produce high-definition shots with all areas."
